                This project uses publicly available data to get possible insights about weather trends in
                Chicago and the corresponding trend in the labor force.

                The analysis utilizes historical weather data from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI),
                specifically the Chicago O'Hare weather station. This is complemented by economic and employment data (CSV format) 
                from the U.S. Bureau Labor Statistics (BLS) public APIs.

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                Although for many people winter season is special because of holidays, winter break from school, or just aesthetics,
                winter brings additional hazards to roads, electric lines, and heating systems. The city of Chicago, for example, uses significant resources
                to aleviate such risks, often going over its snow removal budget. <br><br>
                This project gathered publicly open data on weather and labor force statistics, cleaned the data into a usable
                Pandas DataFrame format, and created Plotly visualizations with the said data to gather insights about the weather 
                and employement trends over the changing seasons. <br><br>
                While some visualizations showed clear trends, others were inconclusive.<br><br>
                This project will start with general insights about the weather. Then it will describe insights about economic behavior 
                of different industries over the years. Lastly, the project will raise a question whether getting economic insights
                based on weather data is viable.

                  The Dual-axis line plot above plots daily minimal temperature (primary y-axis)
                  and amount of daily precipitation in inches (secondary y-axis). <br><br>
                  Excluding the precipitation outliers, such as June 2020 or October 2017, the visualization shows
                  that temperature and precipitation are positively correlated. That is,
                  during warm months, as tge daily temperature increases, so does the 
                  amount of rain. This trend is useful because it shows that the city of 
                  Chicago does not have to concern itself with seasons of high precipitation, 
                  as the rain does not have to be plowed as snow does.

               <p>
                  The statistics described in the box plot above show that the median values 
                  of minimum daily temperatures do not follow a clear increasing or decreasing 
                  trend but rather oscilate around the 42 degrees Fahrenheit mark. From the visualization 
                  it is also clear that in 2019 winter was atypically colder and the summer was hotter than 
                  during any other years, although the median value was at the 41 degree mark.

                  The first graph describes cyclical weather conditions (precipitaition and temperature decreases during winter). 
                  The second graph shows years that are outliers by their temperature values. 
                  Both will be useful in interpreting possible spikes or falls in metrics in visualizations in the following sections. 
                  It is also important to remember social circumstances of data: COVID-19 played a crucial role in labor market, possibly 
                  causing decreases in wages or employment. Therefore, any significant changes in wages in Utilities/Transportation sector that might 
                  have occured due to harsh winter conditions, are likely to be affected by the labor force dynamics caused by the pandemic.
