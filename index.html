                This project uses publicly available data to get possible insights about weather trends in
                Chicago and the corresponding trend in the labor force.

            <p class="small-text text-center">
                The analysis utilizes historical weather data from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI),
                specifically the Chicago O'Hare weather station, years 2015 through 2022. This is complemented by economic and employment data (CSV format) of Chicago
                 and surrounding area (Naperville and Elgin)
                from the U.S. Bureau Labor Statistics (BLS) public APIs (2015-2022 also).

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                Although for many people winter season is special because of holidays, winter break from school, or just aesthetics,
                winter brings additional hazards to roads, electric lines, and heating systems. The city of Chicago, for example, uses significant resources
                to aleviate such risks, often going over its snow removal budget. <br><br>
                This project gathered publicly open data on weather and labor force statistics, cleaned the data into a usable
                Pandas DataFrame format, and created Plotly visualizations with the said data to gather insights about the weather 
                and employement trends over the changing seasons. <br><br>
                While some visualizations showed clear trends, others were inconclusive.<br><br>
                This project will start with general insights about the weather. Then it will describe insights about economic behavior 
                of different industries over the years. Lastly, the project will raise a question whether getting economic insights
                based on weather data is viable.

                  The dual-axis line plot above plots daily minimal temperature (primary y-axis)
                  and amount of daily precipitation in inches (secondary y-axis). <br>
                  Excluding the precipitation outliers, such as June 2020 or October 2017, the visualization shows
                  that temperature and precipitation are positively correlated. That is,
                  during warm months, as tge daily temperature increases, so does the 
                  amount of rain. This trend is useful because it shows that the city of 
                  Chicago does not have to concern itself with seasons of high precipitation, 
                  as the rain does not have to be plowed as snow does.

               <p class="paragraph-text">
                  The statistics described in the box plot above show that the median values 
                  of minimum daily temperatures do not follow a clear increasing or decreasing 
                  trend but rather oscilate around the 42 degrees Fahrenheit mark. From the visualization 
                  it is also clear that in 2019 winter was atypically colder and the summer was hotter than 
                  during any other years, although the median value was at the 41 degree mark.

               <p style="font-size: 1.7em;">
                  The first graph describes cyclical weather conditions (precipitaition and temperature decreases during winter). 
                  The second graph shows years that are outliers by their temperature values. 
                  Both will be useful in interpreting possible spikes or falls in metrics in visualizations in the following sections. 
                  It is also important to remember social circumstances of data: COVID-19 played a crucial role in labor market, possibly 
                  causing decreases in wages or employment. Therefore, any significant changes in wages in Utilities/Transportation sector that might 
                  have occured due to harsh winter conditions, are likely to be affected by the labor force dynamics caused by the pandemic.

                  The box plot shown above compares sectors by average wage change percentages. 
                  This visualization gives insight into which sectors are the most or least stable. 
                  Knowing this can give insight to the city of Chicago or other investors into which  
                  sectors are stable and therefore are a good investment. Additionally, the city government 
                  will know which sectors expect the most cyclical unemployment and to adjust accordingly. <br>
                  The visualization above shows that Financial Activities and Construction services have seen among 
                  the largest average wage increases among all sectors (5.11% increase and 4.97% increase respectively),
                   but not as large as Leisure and Hospitality sector (7.33% average increase over 2015-2022 period). 
                  Goods-Producing and Manufacturing sectors have grown the least (3.05% and 3.14% respectively).
                   From the figure, it can be inferred 
                  that Manufacturing and Goods-Producing sectors are viable and safe investment options.

               <p class="paragraph-text">
                  The two plots above perfectly exemplify the interconnectedness between the economy and 
                  people's wages, since the wages oscillate with the economic cycle. Additionally, the 
                  line plots (running averages of the raw data) show that despite the peaks and troughs of economic cycle, 
                  there is a long-run economic growth. <br>
                  Comparison in wages supports the claims made after the wage change bar chart: 
                  Trade, Transportation, and Utilities sector has seen smaller increase of wages over the years 
                  (4.57% compared to Construction's 4.97%) and, therefore, it had a smaller decrease and faster return to normal 
                  in wages during and after Covid-19. These relationships show that sectors with smaller growth are less volatile 
                  to social circumstances. This means that said sectors are safer investments.<br>
                  Additionally, the increase of wages arround summertime in Construction sector aligns with expectation of increased construction 
                  during warm parts of the year. The increase of wages in Utilities sector during winter aligns with the expectation for higher 
                  heating and electricity demand during cold parts of the year.

                  The scatter plot above shows the variation of average weekly wage amount based on a quarter of the year. 
                  Quarters 1 and 4 have slightly higher wages than quarters 2 and 4. This finding supports the wage valitility caused by
                   the economic cycle 
                  shown in a previous figure. Aside from that, there is not a viable reason to why across all sectors, wages tend to 
                  increase during quarters 1 and 4.

               <p class="paragraph-text">
                  In the figure above, Covid-19 impact is clearly visible because of decrease of both total and taxable wages. 
                  The fact that taxable wages decreased by a much greater relative magnitude than total wages could be explained 
                  by government's targeted relief programs. <br>
                  On the other hand, a sharp decrease in both metrics happened in 2016. There were no major events that could have caused this effect. This 
                  dip could be explained by corrupted Bureau of Labor Statistics data for the 2016 fiscal year.
               </p>
               <p style="font-size: 1.7em;">
                  The data visualizations discussed above help understand the connection between sector volatility due to economic cycle and 
                  wage changes. Apart from the faulty 2016 data in the last figure, all data helps to explain sector volatility and cyclicality 
                  trends. Through data visualizations, effects of Covid-19, as a major social schock, on wages can be traced.
                  <br>
                  Overall, this section supported the claim that sectors that historically see steadier growths are affected by major events (Covid-19 in 
                  my examples) less 
                  and return to the consistent growth faster than higher-growth sectors.

                  The box plots above show employement statistics across years in January and July. The difference 
                  between the two plots is slight, but still important: there are about 20 more thousand people at the median 
                  employed during January than during July. This is a significant difference that will be crucial in understanding 
                  the last data visualization in this section.

                  The scatter plot above shows the relationship between amount of people employed and snow depth. 
                  The vast majority of data points are clustered toward the snow depth of 0 inches, which aligns with the fact that 
                  there is no snow for the majority of the year. With increase of values on the x-axis, the amount of people 
                  employed changes chaotically rather than following a certain trend. <br>
                  No clear conclusion can be made about the relationship of variables can be made from this visualzation.

                  The data visualized above, discussed in Section 3, goes is supported by the box plot trend described 
                  at the beginning of the section. The lower median employment during summertime could explain slightly lower wages 
                  during quarters 3 and 4. This could be explained by people preferring leisure during warm times of the year.
               </p>
               <p style="font-size: 1.7em;">
                  Although data supports the fact of lower employment and wages around summertime, the difference is insignificant. <br>
                  Therefore, it is questionable whether decisive conclusions regarding economic trends can be made based on weather data. 
                  Any visible trends might be observed because of outlier situations rather than natural trends that can be generalized.

            <p style="font-size: 25px;">
                This project used publicly available data to get possible insights about weather trends in Chicago and 
                the corresponding trend in the labor force. The analysis helped to confirm that Trade, Transportation,Utilities 
                and Construction sectors have cyclical wage trends that align with the season, where Construction wages 
                increase in the summer and Utilities wages increase in the winter. <br><br>
                Additionally, sectors with smaller, steadier growth, like Manufacturing and Goods-Producing, appear less volatile
                 to major events such as COVID-19 than higher-growth sectors. They also returned to consistent growth faster,
               making them safer investment options. <br><br>
               it remains questionable whether decisive conclusions regarding broad economic trends can be made based on weather 
               data alone. While weather-related cyclicality is visible in specific industries, the overall correlation between 
               total employment/wages and weather data (like snow depth) was chaotic or insignificant. Any visible trends might 
               be caused by outlier situations rather than natural trends that can be generalized.
