                This project uses publicly available data to get possible insights about weather trends in
                Chicago and the corresponding trend in the labor force.

                The analysis utilizes historical weather data from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI),
                specifically the Chicago O'Hare weather station. This is complemented by economic and employment data (CSV format) 
                from the U.S. Bureau Labor Statistics (BLS) public APIs.

                Although for many people winter season is special because of holidays, winter break from school, or just aesthetics,
                winter brings additional hazards to roads, electric lines, and heating systems. The city of Chicago, for example, uses significant resources
                to aleviate such risks, often going over its snow removal budget. <br><br>
                This project gathered publicly open data on weather and labor force statistics, cleaned the data into a usable
                Pandas DataFrame format, and created Plotly visualizations with the said data to gather insights about the weather 
                and employement trends over the changing seasons. <br><br>
                While some visualizations showed clear trends, others were inconclusive.<br><br>
                This project will start with general insights about the weather. Then it will describe insights about economic behavior 
                of different industries over the years. Lastly, the project will raise a question whether getting economic insights
                based on weather data is viable.
